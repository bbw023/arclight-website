                    personal information.</p>

                <h3>What personal information does Arclight collect?</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your contact details, such as name, address, email and telephone number;</li>
                    <li>Other data you share, upload or create when interacting with the Platform;</li>

                <h3>Can you deal with Arclight anonymously?</h3>
                <p>As a general principle, you have the option of not identifying yourself or using a pseudonym when
                    dealing with Arclight. However, in some cases, if you don't provide us with your personal
                    information, we may not be able to provide you with the product or service that you have requested.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you browse the website, we do not collect your personal information; and</li>
                    <li>You can make a general inquiry without providing your personal details by telephone.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How and why do we collect your personal information?</h3>
                <p>Arclight generally collects personal information directly from you, for example, when you register an
                    account or interact with our Platform. The purposes for which Arclight collects and uses personal
                    information will depend on the nature of your relationship with us, but generally, your information
                    may be collected and used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To facilitate your usage of the Platform;</li>
                    <li>To answer enquiries and provide information to you;</li>
                    <li>To assess the performance of our website and mobile applications and to improve their operation;
                    </li>
                    <li>To undertake analytics activities for the purposes of determining which of our products or
                        services might be of interest to you; and</li>
                    <li>As otherwise required or authorised by law.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How does Arclight use and disclose your personal information?</h3>
                <p>We only use and disclose your personal information for the purpose for which it was collected, or for
                    a related purpose that you would reasonably expect. We may share your personal information with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A related entity of Arclight;</li>
                    <li>An agent, contractor or service provider we engage to carry out our functions and activities,
                        such as our lawyers, accountants, debt collectors or other advisers;</li>
                    <li>Auditors — that are required by law to review Arclight accounts for compliance with accounting
                        standards and internal controls;</li>
                    <li>Regulators — that monitor compliance with legislation such as the Australian Taxation Office
                        (ATO), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and AUSTRAC (where disclosure
                        is required by law).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How does Arclight hold personal information?</h3>
                <p>Arclight takes all reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse,
                    interference, loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We use secure data
                    storage facilities, access controls, and encryption technologies to protect your data.</p>

                <h3>How can you access and correct your personal information?</h3>
                <p>You can request access to, or correction of, your personal information held by Arclight by contacting
                    us using the details below. We will respond to your request within a reasonable time and, in any
                    case, within 30 days. If we refuse your request for access or correction, we will provide you with
                    written reasons for our decision.</p>

                <h3>How can you complain about a breach of privacy?</h3>
                <p>If you believe that Arclight has breached the Australian Privacy Principles or a registered APP code,
                    you may lodge a complaint with us. We will investigate your complaint within a reasonable time and
                    respond to you. If you are not satisfied with our response, you may contact the Office of the
                    Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).</p>

                <h3>Overseas disclosure</h3>
                <p>Arclight may disclose your personal information to overseas recipients in connection with the
                    purposes described above, for example where we use cloud-based services with servers located
                    overseas. We will take reasonable steps to ensure any overseas recipient handles your personal
                    information in a manner consistent with the APPs.</p>

                <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be published on this page. We

                    information.</p>
